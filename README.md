PivotalR
=======

PivotalR is a package that enables users of R, the most popular open source statistical programming language 
and environment to interact with the [Pivotal (Greenplum) Database](http://www.greenplum.com/products/greenplum-database) 
as well as [Pivotal HD](http://www.greenplum.com/products/pivotal-hd) / [HAWQ](http://www.greenplum.com/blog/dive-in/hawq-the-new-benchmark-for-sql-on-hadoop)  
and the open-source database [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) for Big Data 
analytics. It does so by providing an interface to the operations on tables/views in the database. These 
operations are almost the same as those of data.frame. Minimal amount of data is transfered between R and 
the database system. Thus the users of R do not need to learn SQL when they 
operate on the objects in the database. PivotalR also lets the user to run the functions of the open-source 
big-data machine 
learning package [MADlib](http://madlib.net/) directly from R.
